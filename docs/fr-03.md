# Feature Request 03: fancy progress bar

## Context
During the scanning process, it is important for users to have visual feedback on the progress of the scan. Instead of a simple progress bar, or, as it is now, a series a flashing progress messages, we will use the ample space available below the parameters to display a list of the sources being scanned, along with their individual progress. This will provide a more detailed and informative view of the scanning process.

## Implementation
At the beginning of the scan of each source, a new line will be added to the list. Each line will contain the source name and, a progress bar if the total number of events is known, or a simple "scanning" message if the total number of events is not known. The progress bar will be updated as events are processed, providing real-time feedback on the scan's progress. As events are collected, a count of the events retrieved will be displayed next to the source name. Once the scan is complete, the line will be updated to reflect the final count of events retrieved and the status of the scan. The icon used to indicate the final status should be consistent with that used in the `ResultsView` to maintain a cohesive user experience.
As the scan progress, the list will be updated in real-time. The sources with the most recent activity will be displayed at the top of the list, ensuring that users can easily see which sources are currently being processed. This will help users to quickly identify the status of each source and understand the overall progress of the scan.

## Example
```markdown
- [ ] Source 3: Scanning... (13 events)
- [ ] Source 1: Scanning... (0 events)
- [ ] Source 4: Scanning... (5 events)
- [ ] Source 2: Scanning... (0 events)
- [ ] Source 5: Scanning... (1600 events)
```

## Warnings
- the scan is performed in separate threads so the progress bar updates should be thread-safe and not block the main UI thread.
- Ensure that the progress bar updates are efficient and do not cause excessive re-rendering of the UI, which could lead to performance issues.
- The progress bar should be designed to handle a large number of sources without becoming cluttered or difficult to read.
- Ensure that the progress bar updates do not cause performance issues, especially with a large number of sources.
- The design should be responsive and adapt to different screen sizes, ensuring that the progress information is always visible and easy to read.
- Consider the impact of real-time updates on the user interface, ensuring that it remains responsive and accessible.
