# Feature Request 02: scanned sources in the event viewer

## Context
When working online and offline with snapshots, it is important to know which sources were scanned. This feature will add new metadata to the saved snapshots, indicating the sources that were scanned during the event log analysis. This will help users understand if the snapshot is complete and which sources were included in the analysis.

## Implementation
To implement this feature, we will modify the `ScanSession` model in the `Janus.Core` project to include a list of scanned sources. This will be serialized and saved alongside the snapshot data. For each source, the application will store its name, the number of events retrieved and a field indicating if the scan was successful. Some sources may not be accessible to the user if the Janus App executes with limited permissions, so this information will be crucial for understanding the completeness of the snapshot.

## Display
In the `ResultsView`, we will add a new section that displays the scanned sources in the snapshot details pane. The information will be presented as a grid with the following columns:
- **Source Name**: The name of the source that was scanned.
- **Events Retrieved**: The number of events that were successfully retrieved from the source.
- **Scan Status**: A status indicator showing whether the scan was successful or if there were issues accessing the source. The status will be represented with a simple icon and in case of failure color coding will help to quickly identify problematic sources. The list will be sorted alphabetically by source name.
