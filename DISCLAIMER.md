# Lots of AI slop in this repo

## Generative AI abounds
Yes, this repository's content was crafted almost exclusively by generative AI models. This includes code, documentation, and other artifacts. If you are offended, look elsewhere. I am skeptical of the AI hype as much as you are, but I need to learn.

While Janus is meant to be a useful tool in its own right, it is also a playground for experimenting with AI-generated content. It's one of many projects I will conduct abusing AI as much as I can. I am interested in exploring the capabilities and limitations of AI in software development, documentation, and other areas. Call it curiosity, call it a corporate need, unless I know what these tools can do I cannot make informed decisions about their use, their limitations, and their potential. 

The original design work of Janus was done in cooperation with Gemini Pro, but the majority of the implementation was done by OpenAI's GPT-4.1, guided by GitHub Copilot and other AI tools. The documentation was also generated with the help of AI, with minimal human intervention.

This is not to say that the AI did all the the work while the human was sipping coffee (to be honest, he does not drink coffee). GPT-4.1 is a stubborn, gaslighting partner. It very easily falls into rabbit holes it cannot escape from and it needs continuous prodding and supervision. It will happily code extremely ad-hoc solutions into general components and only if told off will it amend its ways.
It showed moments of brilliance, but it also wasted hours of my time following its own misguided suggestions. 
I know very little WPF and I could not have done this without the AI's help, but I also had to learn a lot about WPF to save the AI from itself.

The final code is a hodgepodge of styles and technical solutions. A sort of patchwork which feels like stitched together from innumerable StackOverflow's answers without a common thread. I am a very seasoned software developer and I can tell that this way of writing code is dodgy. Probably hurtful in the long run. Yet, it gets the job done and improvements can come later. Is this what they call "technical debt"? Sure. But in my daily work I have been accumulating technical debt for decades and somehow we survive. The wisdom of age: compromises, thats' all there is to it.

Would I do it again? Yes, I would.
Hopefully Janus will be of use to me and my colleagues. It's something I had wanted for a long time and am glad it I finally have it.
